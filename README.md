# Kaicas
Kaicas An Interpreted Computer Algebraic System

# Project Goal
To create a functioning CAS (Computer Algebraic System) with a unique
language in Java.

# Why Java?
Java will be used for cross platform compatibility reasons. In
addition the Java has some nice built in functionalities such as
garbage collection.

# Project Stages
I.
	Create an interpreted functional language to for which all
	additional functionalities of Kaicas are based on. This will
	be a functional language for ease of developing. See the
	Functional Language Specifications below.

	i.
		Design the specifications for the functional
		language. This should also include specifications for
		higher level structures and function used in the CAS
		part of the program since they must work well together.

	ii.
		Create a lexical analyzer that reads input from a text
		file or command line / terminal input.

	iii.
		Implement the base structure for storing symbols

	iv.
		Implement global variable list.

	v.
		Implement rudimentary functions.

	vi.
		Implement definition function and global function
		list.

II.
	Implement integral functionalities to Kaicas such as
	factoring, expanding, limits, derivatives, integrals, etc.

III.
	Develop a infix to prefix translator for the language. See
	Infix Language Specifications below.

IV.
	Create a GUI for language
